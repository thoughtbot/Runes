# Version Compatibility #

Note that we're aggressive about pushing `master` forward along with new
versions of Swift. Therefore, we highly recommend against pointing at
`master`, and instead using [one of the releases we've provided][releases].

Here is the current Swift compatibility breakdown:

| Swift Version | Runes Version |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 3.X -> 5.X    | 4.X           |
| 2.X           | 3.X           |
| 1.2           | 1.2, 2.X      |
| 1.1           | < 1.2         |
